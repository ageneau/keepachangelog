A Leiningen plugin to automate changelog tasks.
Intended to be used as part of [automated release procedure].

## Usage

First, modify `:plugins` vector of your _project.clj_:

```clj
    :plugins [[lein-changelog "0.3.0"]]
```

Then add `["changelog" "release"]` to `:release-tasks` in your _project.clj_:

```clj
  :release-tasks [... 
                  ["changelog" "release"]
                  ...]
```

If you have no `:release-tasks` key in your _project.clj_, please read more about [custom release tasks] and add it.
Custom `:release-tasks` is necessary to automate changelog work.
  
**IMPORTANT**: the `["changelog" "release"]` has to come after version bumping, because this plugin reads the version from _project.clj_.

Example `:release-tasks` (read more about this specific procedure [here](https://github.com/dryewo/clojure-library-template)):

```clj
  :release-tasks [["vcs" "assert-committed"]
                  ["change" "version" "leiningen.release/bump-version"]
                  ["change" "version" "leiningen.release/bump-version" "release"]
                  ["changelog" "release"]
                  ["vcs" "commit"]
                  ["vcs" "tag"]
                  ["deploy"]
                  ["vcs" "push"]]
```

### If you don't have _CHANGELOG.md_

Run this command to generate a dummy _CHANGELOG.md_ file from template:

    $ lein changelog init

Open the freshly generated _CHANGELOG.md_ file and check the last released version section (it was generated from the latest git tag).
You might want to correct the title and add some details to the section as well.

When you are working on your project, add changes to `## [Unreleased]` section with every commit you make.

### If you have _CHANGELOG.md_

If you didn't use `lein changelog init` to create it, check that it corresponds to the [format](#changelog-format).

When you are ready to release the next version, just run:

    $ lein release :minor

or with `:major` or `:patch`. If you have already configured `:release-tasks` as described above,
`lein changelog release` will be called automatically and will update _CHANGELOG.md_.


## Explanation

When you run

    $ lein changelog release

(or when it's executed as part of `lein release`), this plugin does the following:

1. Reads contents of the _CHANGELOG.md_ file.
2. Replaces `## [Unreleased]` line with `## [X.Y.Z] - 2018-18-18`,  
   where `X.Y.Z` is the version from _project.clj_ and `2018-18-18` is today's date.  
3. Adds a new empty section with `## [Unreleased]` title on top of the file.
4. Inserts links to GitHub diff UI the end of the file:
   * `[X.Y.Z]` to show differences between this released version and previously released one.
   * `[Unreleased]` to show differences between this released version and whatever commits added on top of it but not released yet.

Example:

Given this _CHANGELOG.md_:

```
blah-blah

## [Unreleased]
new-blah

## [0.1.1] - 2018-06-01
old-blah

## 0.1.0 - 2018-01-01
initial-blah

[0.1.1]: https://github.com/your-name/your-repo/compare/0.1.0...0.1.1
[Unreleased]: https://github.com/your-name/your-repo/compare/0.1.1...HEAD
```

Replaces its contents with this:

```
blah-blah

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2018-18-18
new-blah

## [0.1.1] - 2018-06-01
old-blah

## 0.1.0 - 2018-01-01
initial-blah

[0.1.1]: https://github.com/your-name/your-repo/compare/0.1.0...0.1.1
[0.2.0]: https://github.com/your-name/your-repo/compare/0.1.1...0.2.0
[Unreleased]: https://github.com/your-name/your-repo/compare/0.2.0...HEAD
```

### Changelog format

The only required parts here are:

1. `## [Unreleased]` line has to match exactly.
2. There has to be a line that looks like `[Unreleased]: https://github.com/your-name/your-repo/compare/0.2.0...HEAD`  
   It will be used to generate a diff link to the version currently being released (`X.Y.Z`) as well as to the new `[Unreleased]` diff.

If any of these lines are missing, the plugin will fail and exit with a non-zero code.
